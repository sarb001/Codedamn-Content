        <h2>  Inside Iterators </h2>
    </div>

    <!-- Iterators is an Object which implements the for .. of  loop property by having a next method that returns two Object properties 
     First ==> value   Second ==>  done 
    -->


     <!-- If we start with Beginiing that we already have for loops like for in loop which peforms the same Fucntionality 
         but then why we need this Iterators with for of functionlity 

         *** => So Reason is  that In for of loop functionality we have to write pieceof code like this --

           const arr = ["one","second","three"];

           for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
           {
              console.log(arr[i])
           }


           ** Which is gd but we can do better 
           ** -- So we can use for of looop 

           for(let arr of values)
           {
                console.log(values);
           }
    

           ** So Both gives us the Same Functionality  
           but in case of for of loop we used less Code 
           
           
           ** In Both Conditions we have to iterate over full array 
             but what if we want to iterate over  half or want to skip something 
             
             we can do that with iterator 

             ** Syntax is -> 

             var x = ["Apple","Orange","papaya"];

             let y = x[Symbol.iterator]();
             y.next();


             ** Above Lines written is the Syntax  Symbol iskind of datatype which is used for Unique data 
             
             ** next() is used for next element 
             ** So above Code will give us the Output -> Apple 

             ** only gives us one output 
             * writing one more y.next() gives us orange 

             ** So in this way we are able to get any data we want
